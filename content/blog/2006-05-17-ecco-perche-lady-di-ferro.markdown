![](http://www.bbc.co.uk/coventry/content/images/2005/12/09/thatcher_lead_203x152.gif)Il revisionismo inglese affronta uno dei temi più essenziali allo sviluppo della nazione: [la Thatcher è un'icona gay](http://commentisfree.guardian.co.uk/paul_flynn/2006/05/by_paul_flynn.html)?


> **there are echoes of Thatcher in many** **of the** **women** who have become oddly, timely national gay matriarchs since her demise. She is somewhere in the husky tones and brilliantly horsey composer of **Liz Hurley**. She is written through the bolt-upright resolve and take-no-mercy camp of **Sharon Osbourne**. And if you don't recognise her entire genesis in the demonically self-starting entrepreneurialism of **Jordan**, you simply aren't opening your eyes wide enough.
