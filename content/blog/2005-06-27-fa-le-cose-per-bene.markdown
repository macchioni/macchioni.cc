Non c'e nulla di piu inutilmente sfizioso della[ recensione del pecorino
Locatelli](https://www.mcsweeneys.net/links/newfood/#ReviewsofNewFood) firmata da questa sconosciuta Stephanie Palumbo:


> This is the best kind of cheese
that exists, except for maybe really good mozzarella. I like to eat it
on pasta and pizza, and, honestly, it goes with almost anything. Also,
I sometimes buy it in a big chunk and cut it into thin slices. If this
cheese were in a movie, it would be the character that rises to
overcome great odds and succeed in the end, whereas Parmesan would be
lying by the wayside. This cheese is on my Amazon.com Wish List.
