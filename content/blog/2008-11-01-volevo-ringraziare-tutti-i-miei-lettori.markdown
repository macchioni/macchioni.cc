Roberto Saviano [sbarca](https://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/nov/01/italy-gomorrah-roberto-saviano) in Gran Bretagna:


> It is about freedom of speech," he said of the issues surrounding his novel and the reaction to it. "But above all, it is about the freedom of the reader, because what has put me in danger is reading. If what I wrote had ended up in the hands of 20,000 people it would not have generated any problem. What put me in danger is that, because of me, millions of people decided to take an interest in the things that interested me."
