Amy Sohn spiega che [farsi degli amici a New York non è affatto semplice](https://www.newyorkmetro.com/nymetro/nightlife/sex/columns/nakedcity/9888/index.html): «_In the world of friendships, as in the world of relationships, new acquaintances are expected to have something going for them?an ?in,? a résumé, a killer sense of humor or style. If the newcomer is nice but nothing more, it can take him years just to make one new friend_».
