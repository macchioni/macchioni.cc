Ok, this stupid post may be a little too much, but I wrote it down just for fun and somehow I found it worked (well, for me). As you may understand, I don't want to offend anyone, just laugh about some strange connections. Said that, here are the __7 reasons why [John Galliano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Galliano) should totally design next Pope's vest (or what it is called)__.



__1. He has a lot of spare time.__ Mr. Galliano, former Dior's head designer, is talented, free agent and has just [few court hearings](https://www.latimes.com/features/image/alltherage/la-ar-john-galliano-wins-round-in-court-against-dior-20130205,0,2422576.story) to attend, once in a while.

__2. His muse's name is Eva.__ Christianity has the Book of Genesis, the Garden of Eden, Adam & Eve. John has his own Eve, pardon Eva, [Eva Green](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eva_Green).

__3. He likes fancy hats.__ Really fancy ones:

Aren't they cute?

__4. He has also religious issues.__ Technically speaking, Jesus Christ was crucifixes in jewish territory, and for ages christians had a "difficult relationship" with with their older brothers. Galliano's anti-semitic tirades, instead, were officially [the beginning of his end](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Galliano#Suspension_and_dismissal). But he's still missing the point, apparently.

__5. Vatican likes crazy designers.__ I mean, have you ever considered Swiss Guard uniforms?

By the way, the original designer it's not  Michelangelo, but commandant Jules Repond.


__6. He knows something about big jewellery.__ Every Pope needs a large gold ring, the Anulus piscatoris (aka Ring of the fisherman). What would John do? Answer: just look a this 2008 campaign.

__7. He knows how to cut a white dress.__ [Kate Moss' wedding gown](https://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/article/TMG8695186/Kate-Moss-on-her-Galliano-wedding-gown.html) says it all. Enjoy these chaps:
