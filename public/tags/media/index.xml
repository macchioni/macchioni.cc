      <description>The Joshua Topolsky&amp;rsquo;s grocery list of what will matter in the next age of media.
 Compelling voices and stories, real and raw talent, new ideas that actually serve or delight an audience, brands that have meaning and ballast; these are things that matter in the next age of media.

Thinking of your business as a product and storytelling business, not a headline and body-copy business.</description>
