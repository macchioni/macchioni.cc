      <description>This Cambridge Analytica scandal is generating a lot of interesting writing. I should bind that in somewhere. For now, let&amp;rsquo;s pin this.
 It is psychological gravity, not technical inertia, however, that is the greater force against the open web. Human beings are social animals and centralized social media like Twitter and Facebook provide a powerful sense of ambient humanity—the feeling that “others are here”—that is often missing when one writes on one’s own site.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading a lot of good writing about Facebook, lately. Critics are fair and give us a lot to think about our relationship with the always on social network and the idea of &amp;ldquo;Building a global community&amp;rdquo;. As always, even before the Internet, it&amp;rsquo;s not enough we repeat &amp;ldquo;technology is neutral&amp;rdquo;. It is neutral, but we must commit so we get more good than bad, as Kevin Kelly said 7 years ago.</description>

      <description> Maybe after wiping away the thick, grimy film of Facebook friend requests and Vine stars, we can all see the light of day.
