      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading a lot of good writing about Facebook, lately. Critics are fair and give us a lot to think about our relationship with the always on social network and the idea of &amp;ldquo;Building a global community&amp;rdquo;. As always, even before the Internet, it&amp;rsquo;s not enough we repeat &amp;ldquo;technology is neutral&amp;rdquo;. It is neutral, but we must commit so we get more good than bad, as Kevin Kelly said 7 years ago.</description>
