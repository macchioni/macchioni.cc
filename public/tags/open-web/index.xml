      <description>This year started with a small project I really like: Feeds for Journalists, by Dave Winer. The idea is that RSS is still a valid technology to get an effective and unbiased flow of news.
As he puts it, after reading a tweet by Mathew Ingram:
 If you&amp;rsquo;re a journalist and you love RSS, please join me in an easy project to improve both. Let&amp;rsquo;s put together a list of starter feeds for journalists.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ve been walking around in a kind of a daze for weeks and everywhere I go I find myself scribbling something down: open web first.</description>
