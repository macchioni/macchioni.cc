&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://macchioni.cc/images/vault/electric-river.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;electric-river&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One week ago in Perugia, during the annual Journalism Festival, &lt;a href=&#34;http://scripting.com&#34;&gt;Dave Winer&lt;/a&gt; talked about journos taking back their online distribution system, now firmly in silos’ hands (blue silos, big F, you got it). He called that &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.festivaldelgiornalismo.com/programme/2017/plan-b-making-a-home-for-news-on-the-open-web&#34;&gt;Plan B&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First step, he said, forget your readers for a moment and start your own News River. It is something he’s been working on for years, basically a feed aggregator with no fancy stuff. It is radical because, when you use it, you just see what your sources publish when they do it: no algorithms, no distracting images, no ads. It’s like newsrooms in the old times, with the AP feed on your monitor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I’m simplifying but the old News River needed a server, a bit of programming and a few bucks to let everything run. Why bother if you have amazing free products like &lt;a href=&#34;https://feedly.com/&#34;&gt;Feedly&lt;/a&gt;? So now Dave shipped &lt;a href=&#34;http://rss2.io/electric/&#34;&gt;Electric River&lt;/a&gt;, a Mac app easily customizable - well, you can enjoy more if you know some coding - you can run on your desktop with no cost at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I’d be naive if I thought Electric River was that easy. I still think it has a steep learning curve for the average journalist (at least here in Italy).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically you have to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run a Mac.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Know what rss feeds are.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be able to get them from your favorite sources.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have some favorite sources.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mix your sources so you don’t have too much information, aka too much noise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be happy with the super basic OPML editor Dave provided, or tweak your rivers building a few tabs (which I did)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be happy with no images, no embedded videos, no automagical hierarchy, no likes, comments, retweets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All considered I’m good with all the stuff above. But I’d really like some improvements to make Electric River not just a techie smart app but an app a journalist could use more at work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;actual-improvements&#34;&gt;ACTUAL IMPROVEMENTS&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;some kind of pagination: because if you’ve been away for a while, you lose too much news.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;search: I’d start with some &lt;code&gt;cmd + F&lt;/code&gt; for searching the page, but a search box would be amazing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;stars/readitlater: some kind of selecting items so you can work them later or just remember.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;synch: Electric River is totally desktop, but our lives are mobile and multi-device. Some kind of feed memory would help.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sharing: Dave offers his awesome &lt;a href=&#34;http://radio3.io/&#34;&gt;Radio3&lt;/a&gt; for tweeting and posting on Facebook. I’d love some more customization for sharing directly in Instapaper, Pinboard, Slack etc…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All of the above functions are already available from Feedly, Feedbin, etc…
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;ui-stuff&#34;&gt;UI STUFF&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’d really could use a “Return to Top” arrow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’d love to change the default font, text size, and background (like you can on Kindle or Instapaper).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is my feedback after one week. Electric River is only 0.40e, so it has still to grow.&lt;/p&gt;
