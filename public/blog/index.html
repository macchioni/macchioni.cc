<blockquote>
<p>It is psychological gravity, not technical inertia, however, that is the greater force against the open web. Human beings are social animals and centralized social media like Twitter and Facebook provide a powerful sense of ambient humanity—the feeling that “others are here”—that is often missing when one writes on one’s own site.</p>

        <div class="article"><p>A proposito delle <a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elezioni_politiche_italiane_del_2018">elezioni italiane del 4 marzo</a>, credo che non dovrebbe andar perduta <a href="https://www.wittgenstein.it/2018/03/05/quanto-vi-crediate-assolti/">questa riflessione di Luca Sofri</a> sulle modalità narrative del sistema dell&rsquo;informazione italiana e sui messaggi che passano o no.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Quello di cui sono fatti i media italiani (giornali, programmi tv del pomeriggio, dichiarazioni di politici, eccetera, l’informazione) è testi e titoli: passano i titoli. Quello di cui sono fatti i media italiani è riflessioni accurate e sensazionalismo: passa il sensazionalismo. Quello di cui sono fatti i media italiani è immagine di progresso e terrorismo: passa il terrorismo. Quello di cui sono fatti i media italiani è spirito di convivenza e risentimento aizzato: passa il risentimento. Quello di cui sono fatti i media italiani è spiegazione dei fenomeni e litigio nei talk show: passa il litigio. Quello di cui sono fatti i media italiani è vero complesso e falso semplice: passa il falso.</p>

<p>[&hellip;] Perché non è vero che “tanta gente non si informa”: è vero che tanta gente – disabituata da decenni di media sciatti e cinici alla comprensione del mondo – registra solo le comunicazioni terroristiche, false, divisive e sobillatrici, delle quali sono complici tutti quanti, quelli che ora commentano l’inatteso 5%.</p>

        <span class="article-date" class="dt-published" class="p-name">February 2, 2018</span><br />
       
        <div class="article">

<p><img src="/images/vault/pinker.jpg" alt="pinker" /></p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Pinker">Steven Pinker</a>&rsquo;s latest fatigue, <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/317051/enlightenment-now-by-steven-pinker/9780525427575/">Enlightment Now</a>, has already been tagged like the book everyone has to read - well - now. His big sponsor is a guy named <a href="https://qz.com/1192746/bill-gates-book-recommendation-steven-pinkers-enlightenment-now/">Bill Gates</a> and actually Pinker has a few bullets in his belt.</p>

<p>The book&rsquo;s central idea is that we tend to forget the forces of progress the world has experienced, because our natural pessimism is reinforced every day by politics, media and viral false-beliefs.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t read <em>Enlightenment Now</em> yet, but watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s2qyYQIRQE">this Pinker&rsquo;s Keynote</a>, I took a few notes useful for journalists and readers*.</p>

<p><img src="/images/vault/sentiment.jpg" alt="sentiment" /></p>

<h3 id="your-op-ed-is-not-a-sign-of-the-imminent-end-of-the-world">Your op-ed is not a sign of the imminent end of the world</h3>

<p>Pinker says that the first thing any media org has to do is place news in their historical and statistical context. Do you think that they teach that in Jounalism 101? Maybe they do, but media outlets often forget about that.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Op-eds should not use something blew up yesterday as the indication that the world is getting worse.</p></li>

<li><p>All claims have to be backed up by statistical data and comparisons with past periods. As Professor P. says: «Things may suck now, but in many cases they were worse in the past» (Vietnam War was worse than Syrian conflict).</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="humans-need-help-to-be-reasonable">Humans need help to be reasonable</h3>

<p>Human beings, says Pinker, are not particularly reasonable.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We&rsquo;re likely to generalize from anecdotes, stereotypes, conspiracy theories. But people are capable of reason, if they establish certain norms and institutions: free speech, open debate and criticism, logical analysis, fact-checking and empirical testing.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="media-can-scale-sympathy">Media can scale sympathy</h3>

<p>According to Pinker «humanism, the idea that the ultimate moral purpose is to reduce the suffering and enhance the flourishing of human beings and other creatures». But we often fail, because we have a natural bias.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>By default our circle of sympathy is rather puny. We tend to feel the pain of our relatives, friends, allies, friends and cute little fuzzy animals.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But this instinct can be expanded by what he calls &ldquo;forces of cosmopolitanism&rdquo;: education, art, mobility and&hellip; journalism.</p>

<h3 id="if-you-read-papers-you-underestimate-progress">If you read papers, you underestimate progress</h3>

<p>Why do people deny progress? Part of the answer, says Pinker, comes from a psychological quirk called &ldquo;Availability heuristics&rdquo;: human assess risk based on how easily they recall examples from memory.
And we, journalists, are memory makers. So, if we combine the nature of news and cognition, you get the idea that the world is getting more dangerous.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>News is about stuff that happens, not about stuff that doesn&rsquo;t happen. You never see a reporter saying: &ldquo;Here I am in a country that is not a war&rdquo;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="/images/vault/heuristic.jpg" alt="heuristic" /></p>

<p>The other force to consider is something called &ldquo;negativity bias&rdquo;: our idea that bad is stronger than good.</p>

<p>But newspapers and TVs cannot stop reporting the bad news, so what&rsquo;s the psychologist answer to that?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Of course it is essential to become aware of suffering and injustice when they occur, but also have to be aware on how they can be reduced. There are dangers with thoughtless pessimism.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Do we have to balance more bad news with good news?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The point is to give a picture to the world of what&rsquo;s going wrong, but still have a clear signal of what actually helps it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="pessimistic-audiences-vote-wrong-leaders">Pessimistic audiences vote wrong leaders</h3>

<p>The narrative of pessimism makes people think things are getting worse, and voters can polarize around charismatic (or populistic) leaders.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If the picture of the world is that there are no solutions, the rational response would be just drop your hands and say: well, let&rsquo;s enjoy life while we can.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="journalism-has-a-future">Journalism has a future</h3>

<p>Institutions like science and journalism have to open up their workings, reinforce their methods of arriving to ways to get to their claims. Using peer reviews, fact-checkings: without these metods fallacies and ignorance will prosper.</p>

<h3 id="other-bullets">Other bullets</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>Problems are inevitables, but problems are solvable, even if solutions bring new problems. That&rsquo;s progress.</p>

<p>Humans are always vulnerable to fake news and misinformation and conspiracy theories. But since we do have to trust others, we must know which authority to trust.</p>

<p>Knowledge is hard. You shouldn&rsquo;t trust anyone, but people should take more serious people with a verified track record. You got to earn the authority.</p>

<p>Intellectuals hate progress.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This year started with a small project I really like: <a href="https://github.com/scripting/feedsForJournalists">Feeds for Journalists</a>, by <a href="http://scripting.com/">Dave Winer</a>. The idea is that RSS is still a valid technology to get an effective and unbiased flow of news.</p>

<p>As he puts it, after reading <a href="https://twitter.com/mathewi/status/952214692918734848">a tweet by Mathew Ingram</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a journalist and you love RSS, please join me in an easy project to improve both. Let&rsquo;s put together a list of starter feeds for journalists.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Basically, we’re sharing our RSS bookmarks considering  only the accountable sources. Since <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/11/16881102/facebook-news-feed-changes-meaningful-interactions">Facebook is pivoting from its initial position regarding news and its News Feed</a>, I think even the timing of <a href="https://github.com/scripting/feedsForJournalists">Feeds for Journalists</a> is right.</p>

<p>When good ol’ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Reader">Google Reader</a> was killed by Google, I continued using RSS via Feedly, Inoreader and <a href="http://rss2.io/electric/">Electric River</a> (the latter also by Dave). RSS is still the best option for massive news browsers, an indispensabile technology in any newsroom. Give it a try.</p>

<p><em>Update:</em> Dave made a <a href="http://scripting.com/journalists/">useful river here</a>.</p>

<p><em>Bonus: since we spoke about Zuck, Frederic Filloux says <a href="https://mondaynote.com/facebook-is-done-with-quality-journalism-deal-with-it-afc2475f1f84">Facebook has all the reasons in the world to get rid of journalism</a>.</em></p>
