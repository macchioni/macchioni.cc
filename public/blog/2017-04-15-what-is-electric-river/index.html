<p>One week ago in Perugia, during the annual Journalism Festival, <a href="http://scripting.com">Dave Winer</a> talked about journos taking back their online distribution system, now firmly in silos’ hands (blue silos, big F, you got it). He called that <a href="http://www.festivaldelgiornalismo.com/programme/2017/plan-b-making-a-home-for-news-on-the-open-web">Plan B</a>.</p>

<p>First step, he said, forget your readers for a moment and start your own News River. It is something he’s been working on for years, basically a feed aggregator with no fancy stuff. It is radical because, when you use it, you just see what your sources publish when they do it: no algorithms, no distracting images, no ads. It’s like newsrooms in the old times, with the AP feed on your monitor.</p>

<p>Now I’m simplifying but the old News River needed a server, a bit of programming and a few bucks to let everything run. Why bother if you have amazing free products like <a href="https://feedly.com/">Feedly</a>? So now Dave shipped <a href="http://rss2.io/electric/">Electric River</a>, a Mac app easily customizable - well, you can enjoy more if you know some coding - you can run on your desktop with no cost at all.</p>

<p>I did it.</p>

<p>But I’d be naive if I thought Electric River was that easy. I still think it has a steep learning curve for the average journalist (at least here in Italy).</p>

<p>Basically you have to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Run a Mac.</li>
<li>Know what rss feeds are.</li>
<li>Be able to get them from your favorite sources.</li>
<li>Have some favorite sources.</li>
<li>Mix your sources so you don’t have too much information, aka too much noise.</li>
<li>Be happy with the super basic OPML editor Dave provided, or tweak your rivers building a few tabs (which I did)</li>
<li>Be happy with no images, no embedded videos, no automagical hierarchy, no likes, comments, retweets.</li>
</ul>

<p>All considered I’m good with all the stuff above. But I’d really like some improvements to make Electric River not just a techie smart app but an app a journalist could use more at work.</p>

<h5 id="actual-improvements">ACTUAL IMPROVEMENTS</h5>

<ul>
<li>some kind of pagination: because if you’ve been away for a while, you lose too much news.</li>
<li>search: I’d start with some <code>cmd + F</code> for searching the page, but a search box would be amazing.</li>
<li>stars/readitlater: some kind of selecting items so you can work them later or just remember.</li>
<li>synch: Electric River is totally desktop, but our lives are mobile and multi-device. Some kind of feed memory would help.</li>
<li>sharing: Dave offers his awesome <a href="http://radio3.io/">Radio3</a> for tweeting and posting on Facebook. I’d love some more customization for sharing directly in Instapaper, Pinboard, Slack etc…</li>
<li>All of the above functions are already available from Feedly, Feedbin, etc…
<br /></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="ui-stuff">UI STUFF</h4>

<ul>
<li>I’d really could use a “Return to Top” arrow.</li>
<li>I’d love to change the default font, text size, and background (like you can on Kindle or Instapaper).</li>
</ul>

<p>That is my feedback after one week. Electric River is only 0.40e, so it has still to grow.</p>
