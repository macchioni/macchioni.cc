      <description>In the last few years we&amp;rsquo;ve been seduced by the wonderful world of social media and social networks. They work beautifully. Unfortunately that means we&amp;rsquo;ve progressively lost control over our content and locked many of the web content into the social media walled gardens, accepting that our data may be used, bought and sold.
It&amp;rsquo;s a matter of privacy and a matter of freedom.
I believe, like the founding fathers of the World Wide Web, in a different kind of Internet.</description>

      <title>La mia storia con internet</title>
      <link>https://macchioni.cc/blog/2018-04-25-la-mia-storia-internet/</link>

      <description>La mia storia con internet è cominciata da qualche parte negli Anni 90, in un internet cafè di Trastevere, a Roma. Eravamo in 6-8 compagni di scuola, davanti a un monitor 14’’, e non avevamo idea di che cosa scrivere nel box di ricerca. Ricordo che mi toccò l’onore della digitazione per due motivi: uno, avevo un computer in casa; due, perché qualche tempo prima, a casa dell’amico di un’amico “che ci capiva”, avevo visto comparire dopo una lunga attesa l’immagine di uno di quei manga un po’ porno che popolavano già gli scaffali della sua libreria.</description>

      <title>The psychological gravity of Facebook</title>
      <link>https://macchioni.cc/blog/2018-03-27-facebook-psychological-gravity/</link>

      <description>This Cambridge Analytica scandal is generating a lot of interesting writing. I should bind that in somewhere. For now, let&amp;rsquo;s pin this.
 It is psychological gravity, not technical inertia, however, that is the greater force against the open web. Human beings are social animals and centralized social media like Twitter and Facebook provide a powerful sense of ambient humanity—the feeling that “others are here”—that is often missing when one writes on one’s own site.</description>

      <description>Remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet. Try to make sense of what you see and wonder about what makes the universe exist. Be curious. And however difficult life may seem, there is always something you can do and succeed at. It matters that you don’t just give up.

      <description>A proposito delle elezioni italiane del 4 marzo, credo che non dovrebbe andar perduta questa riflessione di Luca Sofri sulle modalità narrative del sistema dell&amp;rsquo;informazione italiana e sui messaggi che passano o no.
 Quello di cui sono fatti i media italiani (giornali, programmi tv del pomeriggio, dichiarazioni di politici, eccetera, l’informazione) è testi e titoli: passano i titoli. Quello di cui sono fatti i media italiani è riflessioni accurate e sensazionalismo: passa il sensazionalismo.</description>

      <title>What Steven Pinker&#39;s Enlightenment Now can teach to journalism</title>

      <description>Steven Pinker&amp;rsquo;s latest fatigue, Enlightment Now, has already been tagged like the book everyone has to read - well - now. His big sponsor is a guy named Bill Gates and actually Pinker has a few bullets in his belt.
The book&amp;rsquo;s central idea is that we tend to forget the forces of progress the world has experienced, because our natural pessimism is reinforced every day by politics, media and viral false-beliefs.</description>

      <description>This year started with a small project I really like: Feeds for Journalists, by Dave Winer. The idea is that RSS is still a valid technology to get an effective and unbiased flow of news.
As he puts it, after reading a tweet by Mathew Ingram:
 If you&amp;rsquo;re a journalist and you love RSS, please join me in an easy project to improve both. Let&amp;rsquo;s put together a list of starter feeds for journalists.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s always mystery. You both know that. You both know it isn&amp;rsquo;t perfect. Excitement, trust and struggle, and the unknown privacies that keep us together. Glue of struggle. I raise my glass. The fragile glass we stomped on and shattered and will forever be putting back together, like the puzzles we first worked as children, learning to be patient, searching for what fits.

      <title>A disconnected generation</title>

      <description>We are constantly dazzled and blinded by power. We tend to allow and enable our leaders to play by a different set of moral rules and laws. While we distract ourselves with stupid selfies and pictures of our latest dinner, the real world around us spins out of control. Will we go down in history as the generation of connectivity that constantly disconnected itself from reality? I say - to hell with success and authority.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading a lot of good writing about Facebook, lately. Critics are fair and give us a lot to think about our relationship with the always on social network and the idea of &amp;ldquo;Building a global community&amp;rdquo;. As always, even before the Internet, it&amp;rsquo;s not enough we repeat &amp;ldquo;technology is neutral&amp;rdquo;. It is neutral, but we must commit so we get more good than bad, as Kevin Kelly said 7 years ago.</description>

      <title>The best food review of the year</title>

      <description>I believe this is the best food review I’ve read this year.
 Black Axe Mangal Lamb Offal Flatbread* There are dicks and vaginas on the floor. Metallica on the sound system, and the menu sometimes features something called a deepthroater. It’s so tempting to hate it. But then you eat former St John head chef Lee Tiernan’s dayglovibrant riffs on kebab-house fare, and you can’t help but acknowledge that you’re eating the future.</description>
