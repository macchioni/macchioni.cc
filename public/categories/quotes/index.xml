      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s always mystery. You both know that. You both know it isn&amp;rsquo;t perfect. Excitement, trust and struggle, and the unknown privacies that keep us together. Glue of struggle. I raise my glass. The fragile glass we stomped on and shattered and will forever be putting back together, like the puzzles we first worked as children, learning to be patient, searching for what fits.

      <description> «No matter in what city or what country I happen to find myself, the outside world I observe as I wander the streets presents me with the exciting, the mysterious or the erotic; my eyes roam freely over these sights and I release the shutter whenever I feel the urges of eternal desire or temptation»
